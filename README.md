# Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs **market basket analysis** on the **Online Retail Dataset**. The analysis leverages the **Apriori Algorithm** to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules. It also includes visualizations and a simple recommendation system.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and filters unwanted transactions.
- **Frequent Itemset Mining**: Implements the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent patterns.
- **Association Rules Generation**: Generates actionable rules with support, confidence, and lift metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Provides insights through graphs, such as itemset distributions and network visualizations.
- **Recommendation System**: Recommends products based on association rules.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the **Online Retail Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx).
